- This is a react.js project. 
- At the start of each file, should be a comment with the file path from the project root.
- Use tabs and not spaces.
- Never change line endings unless explicitly requested.
- Never change the file structure you were not specifically requested.
- Never make up features you were not specifically requested.
- Never delete anything you were not specifically requested.
- You may advise me to add or delete things I didn't request but not do it yourself.
- Avoid usage of too generic names such as get and set. Be specific and write clean code.
- First explain to yourself what you are about to do and only then do it.
- If you are not sure about something, ask me. You can also ask me to show you required files.
- Don't inline things that are generic. Extract them to files to avoid repetition and circular dependencies.
- All code should be environment agnostic.
- Use standard naming and standard conventions.
- Use winston for logging.
- Use the most specific commands possible, for example isfile() is better than exists().
- Attempt to write code that will lint without errors. For example, remove unused imports and variables.
